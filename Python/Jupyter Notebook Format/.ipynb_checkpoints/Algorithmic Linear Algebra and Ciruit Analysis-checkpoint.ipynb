    "This final case illustrates the interaction between voltage sources, focussing ont eh loop from V2 through resistors R2m R7, and R1, with the voltage difference between V2 and V1 making V1 act as ground. This is equivalent to V2 being 9 and V1 being ground, as seen in the comparison from the first output to the second. This is confirmed by the equivalent values of resistors not including R3,R4,R5,R6 and R8, effictively removing the actual ground from the circuit. Currents through R1,R2, and R7 are the same in both instances, as expected- this gives me faith that this system is an accurate/ideal representation of this circuit"
